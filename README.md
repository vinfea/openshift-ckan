> ℹ️ *The language badges above (created using [Shields.io](https://shields.io/)) link to the README files, to be maintained in both English ([README.md](README.md)) and French ([README_FR.md](README_FR.md)). See instructions (👉 in italics) and example content provided under each section header below. The format of the README template has been designed such that, in most use cases, only the `About` and `Credits` sections need be replaced by the user and customized to their projects, keeping all other sections as is. However, the format may be changed/adapted as needed, provided the content under sections indicated as required are included. For instance, if the combined content is brief, the four sections - `Credits`, `Citation`, `Contribution`, and `References` - may be consolidated into a single section titled `Acknowledgements`.*

## Table of Contents

> 👉 *OPTIONAL: The Table of Contents (TOC) may be omitted if the overall content is brief. The TOC can be easily autogenerated, for example, by running command [Create Table of Contents](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one#table-of-contents) in the VSCode extension `Markdown All in One`. To exclude a heading from appearing in the autogenerated TOC, add `<!-- omit in toc -->` at the end of that heading or just above it. The TOC will be auto-updated whenever the file is saved after heading changes.*

## About

> 👉 *REQUIRED: Provide a summary, purpose, and key features of the project.*

This repository serves as a template for creating reproducible and customizable data processing workflows. It is designed to help researchers and developers quickly set up new projects by providing modular and parameterized components that can be easily adapted to different use cases. The template may be customized, adding/removing sections as needed, while maintaining good documentation.

## Documentation

> 👉 *REQUIRED: All technical documentation should be kept separate from the README, ideally in a dedicated `docs` folder. Technical documents may be maintained in either English or French. See [/docs/user-guide.md](/docs/user-guide.md) for a `user guide` template. Where resources allow and demand exists, the technical documentation may be maintained in both languages, in which case, those may even be incorporated into the respective READMEs.*

For technical details, including installation and usage instructions, please refer to the [User Guide](/docs/user-guide.md).
