# .gitignore
# This file tells Git which files and directories to ignore when tracking changes in this repository.
# Ignored files will not be included in commits or pushed to the remote repository.

# Basic Rules:
# - Lines starting with "#" are comments and ignored by Git.
# - To ignore a file, write its name (e.g., "example.txt").
# - To ignore all files in a directory, use a trailing slash (e.g., "logs/").
# - Use "*" as a wildcard to match multiple files (e.g., "*.log" ignores all .log files).
# - To un-ignore a specific file in an ignored directory, use "!" (e.g., "!important.txt").

# This .gitignore template is language-agnostic and safe for most projects, while still covering 
# common OS, editor, and tooling artifacts. Feel free to customize it further based on your project's
# specific needs.
