### Describe the Solution You'd Like

A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Example**: "Add support for paired-end reads in the alignment step by accepting two input files (`read1.fastq` and `read2.fastq`) and producing a single `aligned_reads.bam` file."

### Describe Alternatives You've Considered

A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you’ve considered.

**Example**:

- "Manually combining paired-end reads into a single file before running the pipeline, but this introduces potential data quality issues."
